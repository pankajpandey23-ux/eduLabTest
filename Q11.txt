
Write the Queries to implement
a) Equi Join
b) Non-Equi Join
c) Self Join
d) Full Outer Join



a)Suppose we have two tables, "employees" and "departments", and we want to join them on the "department_id" column. The query for an equi join would be:

SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id;


b)Suppose we have two tables, "orders" and "customers", and we want to join them on the "order_total" column where the order total is greater than the customer's credit limit. The query for a non-equi join would be:

SELECT o.order_id, o.order_total, c.customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c
ON o.order_total > c.credit_limit;

c)Suppose we have a table "employees" with columns "employee_id", "employee_name", and "manager_id". We want to join the table to itself to find the names of employees and their managers. The query for a self join would be:

SELECT e.employee_name, m.employee_name AS manager_name
FROM employees e
JOIN employees m
ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;


d)Suppose we have two tables, "customers" and "orders", and we want to join them to show all customers and all orders, even if there are no orders for a particular customer. The query for a full outer join would be:


SELECT c.customer_name, o.order_id
FROM customers c
FULL OUTER JOIN orders o
ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id;
